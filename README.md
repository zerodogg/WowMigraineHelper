# WoW Migraine Helper

Some areas in WoW have graphics that can hurt for people who suffer from
Migraines. This is a hack containing two different helpers that can mitigate
some of the effect.

## Dark overlay

This toggles an opacity layer above the screen, making the game world a lot
darker than normal, while the UI remains normal. You can bind this to a key, or
use the command `/migrainedark`.

## Edge overlay

This toggles black bars around the screen, which can be used to hide effects
like the "Cloak of Ve'nari". You can bind this to a key, or use the command
`/migraineedge`.
