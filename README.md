# WoW Migraine Helper

[![pipeline status](https://gitlab.com/zerodogg/WowMigraineHelper/badges/master/pipeline.svg)](https://gitlab.com/zerodogg/WowMigraineHelper/-/commits/master)

Some areas in WoW have graphics that can hurt for people who suffer from
Migraines. This is a hack containing two different helpers that can mitigate
some of the effect.

## Helper modes

### Dark overlay

This toggles an opacity layer above the screen, making the game world a lot
darker than normal, while the UI remains normal. By default this is bound to
`CTRL-ALT-D`, or you can use `/migrainedark`.

### Edge overlay

This toggles black bars around the screen, which can be used to hide effects
like the "Cloak of Ve'nari". Any UI elements placed on the edges of the screen
work as normal.  By default this is bound to `CTRL-ALT-M`, or you can use
`/migraineedge`.


## Key bindings

If you want to change (or unbind) the default keybindings, you can do so in the
WoW "Key Bindings" window under "Other".
