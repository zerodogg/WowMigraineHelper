# WoW Migraine Helper

[![pipeline status](https://gitlab.com/zerodogg/WowMigraineHelper/badges/master/pipeline.svg)](https://gitlab.com/zerodogg/WowMigraineHelper/-/commits/master)

Some areas in WoW have graphics that can hurt for people who suffer from
Migraines. This is a hack containing two different helpers that can mitigate
some of the effect.

## Helper modes

### Dark overlay

This toggles an opacity layer above the screen, making the game world a lot
darker than normal, while the UI remains normal. By default this is bound to
`CTRL-ALT-D`, or you can use `/migrainedark`.

### Edge overlay

This toggles black bars around the screen, which can be used to hide effects
like the "Cloak of Ve'nari". Any UI elements placed on the edges of the screen
work as normal.  By default this is bound to `CTRL-ALT-M`, or you can use
`/migraineedge`.

## Configuration

To configure Migraine Helper, open up the addon settings panel (`Esc` ->
`Interface` -> `AddOns` -> `Migraine Helper`). There you can select the width
and height of the edge overlay, the opacity of the dark overlay and configure
the key bindings.
